%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to wholeheartedly my supervisor \textbf{Mr. Georg Groh}, who advised my Master's Thesis at TUM and kept me encouraged during the whole time. He played a pivotal role in me continuing the study in the area of my interest and help me chase the state of the art systems with utmost frivolity. I would also thank, \textbf{Prof. Hinrich Schütze}, with whom, I started this study with an interdisciplinary project at Ludwig Maximillian's University (München) and his supervision helped me to get started with the new topic of Deep Learning and its application to Natural Language Processing. Additionally, I would thank my previous guide, \textbf{Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharrya},(Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay) who introduced the field of Natural Language Processing and helped kick-start my interest in the field and encouraged me continuously to aim higher and helped me open my mind to look at problems from various perspectives..  

In the end, I would also like to thank my family, who gave me this opportunity to study at Technical University of Munich, Germany. Without them, nothing of this would be possible.
