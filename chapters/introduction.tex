\section{Information Gathering, Opinions and Sentiment}
"\textit{What other people think}", has been a very important element in the overall decision making process. This is more relevant in the modern era with the explosion of web and internet based services where the people have a new platform where they can voice their opinions and discuss about day to day things. With the advent of this platform, the subjective information too has grown severely rapidly over the years.  
\newline
It is interesting to note that the social opinion of users impact a large corpus of audience. A simple case example is, that if a product is negatively perceived in the social circles of the internet, it will not be taken positively by a new user who is interested in purchasing the product. This also is hence a tool for organizations to understand how the product is performing in the public. 
\newline
In the modern day, organizations have significant investments to process this vast amount of data and make sense of the important information contained in it, so that they can leverage their products and services and improve their overall user experience or increase chances of making more profit, by identifying key areas which are causing an indirect impact on the overall balance statement.
