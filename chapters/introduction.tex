\section{Information Gathering, Opinions and Sentiment}
"\textit{What other people think}", has been a very important element in the overall decision making process. This is more relevant in the modern era with the explosion of web and internet based services where the people have a new platform where they can voice their opinions and discuss about day to day things. With the advent of this platform, the information has grown severely rapidly over the years. Modern day companies have significant investments to process this vast amount of data and make sense of the important information contained in it, so that they can leverage their products and services and improve their overall user experience or increase chances of making more profit, by identifying key areas which are causing an indirect impact on the overall balance statement.
